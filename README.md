## Introduction to Unix shell - Part 2

This short course is based on some reference style notes and exercises. Start by looking at the notes and trying to solve some exercises in parallel.

Begin here: [Notes](Notes1.md). Try to go through the [Orientation](Orientation.md) exercise and understand how the most basic commands work. Even if this isn't your first time with shell, you might find it useful as a refresher.

Then attempt the [Exercises](Exercises1.md). [Answers](Answers1.md) to exercises. Please only check them once you have given the exercises a proper try.

Continue with [Notes 2](Notes2.md), attempting the [Exercises 2](Exercises2.md). (You don't necessarily have to solve every single scripting one, it might take too long, just try a couple.) [Answers 2](Answers2.md) to exercises 2. Please only check them once you have given the exercises a proper try.

If you are done with it all, learn about [Git](Notes2.md#miscellaneous), create a new repository on GitHub and upload your answer scripts to that repository.

This is the part where I'd love to link to my personal website, but it is still work in progress, so for now I'll just leave a link to the [verb conjugation resource in many languages](http://cooljugator.com) that I built together with a friend over the past year. Lots of shell scripting was used in the process of building it, and I actually used my own course notes as reference all the time!:D
