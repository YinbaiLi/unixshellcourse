# Unix shell course

Hello and welcome to this course!

**Part II BBS Bioinformatics** - 15:00-17:00, 14 Jan 2019
1. We begin by working through the [Orientation](Orientation.md) exercise. You can either copy what I am doing on the screen or work through it faster on your own. Refer to [Notes](Notes1.md) for some explanations and further examples.
2. Attempt the [Exercises](Exercises1.md). [Answers](Answers1.md) to exercises are available but please only check them once you have given the exercises a fair try. I will be walking around the room if you have any questions.

Part 2 of the course is optional, you're welcome to continue with it after finishing Part 1, or to complete it at home.

This is the part where I'd love to link to my personal website, but it is still work in progress, so for now I'll just leave a link to the [verb conjugation resource in many languages](http://cooljugator.com) that I built together with a friend over the past year. Lots of shell scripting was used in the process of building it, and I actually used my own course notes as reference all the time!:D
