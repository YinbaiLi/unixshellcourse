# Unix shell course

Hello and welcome to this course! Slightly different versions of this course are being taught to different audiences. Please follow the correct instructions for your session.

**Part II BBS Bioinformatics** - 15:00-17:00, 15 Jan 2018
1. We begin by working through the [Orientation](Orientation.md) exercise. You can either copy what I am doing on the screen or work through it faster on your own. Refer to [Notes](Notes1.md) for some explanations and further examples.
2. Attempt the [Exercises](Exercises1.md). [Answers](Answers1.md) to exercises are available but please only check them once you have given the exercises a proper try. I will be walking around the room if you have any questions.
Part 2 of the course is optional, you're welcome to complete it at home.

**Cambridge Bioinformatics Training** - 13:00-17:00, 16 Jan 2018

5. Optional. If you are done with it all and still have time (and energy!), learn about [Git](Notes2.md#miscellaneous), create a new repository on GitHub and upload your answer scripts to that repository.

**Part III Systems Biology** - 10:00-13:00, 7 Feb 2018
1. Work through the [Orientation](Orientation.md) exercise. You should have already met most of these commands before, use this exercise as a quick refresher.

This is the part where I'd love to link to my personal website, but it is still work in progress, so for now I'll just leave a link to the [verb conjugation resource in many languages](http://cooljugator.com) that I built together with a friend over the past year. Lots of shell scripting was used in the process of building it, and I actually used my own course notes as reference all the time!:D
