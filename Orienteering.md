### Introduction

This extended exercise is intended as a way to familiarise yourself with (or refresh your memory of) the most basic commands in shell. Work through the commands sequentially, trying to understand exactly what's happening at each step and answering the questions. Refer to [Notes](Notes1.md) for help.

### Orienteering

Try the following commands (one command per line) to learn to navigate around your file system. Explore! N.B. The commands are not listed in any particular order in this section.

```bash
pwd
ls
cd [folder name]
ls -l
man ls #hit <q> to exit, <space> to move down one page
ls -lht
cd ..
cd ~
cd -
```

Come back to some cosy home directory where you can play around without wrecking havoc on your computer.
